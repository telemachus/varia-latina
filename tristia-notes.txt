On 1-2: The word order of this sentence is complex and not immediately obvious.
In order to make sense of it, start with the basics: only \textit{accipe}
appears to be a main verb. Hence, that will be the start.  Both \textit{fuerim}
and \textit{noris} are subjunctives, while \textit{legis} is indicative.  One
of the two subjunctive clauses will depend on \textit{accipe}, and the other
clause will likely depend on the first.  The two choices are \textit{accipe,
posteritas, ut noris qui fuerim ille ego \lips} or \textit{accipe, posteritas,
qui fuerim ille ego ut noris \lips}. The first makes more sense since the verb
\textit{noris} receives its expected object if we take things that way.  This
leaves \textit{tenerorum lusor amorum} and \textit{quem legis}, both of which
can follow the \textit{qui fuerim} clause.
