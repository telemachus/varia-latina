# Commentary on various Latin poems

## What is this?

This repository will store LaTeX text and commentary on various Latin poems. At
the moment, there's a full text and part of a commentary on *Tristia* IV 10,
Ovid's autobiographical poem.

If you have LaTeX, you should be able to build a pdf of the document by running
`make tristia`. If you don't want to bother with that, you can also [download
pdfs from this site][pdf].

## How can I help?

I would love feedback on anything (my terrible LaTeX, the text, or the
commentary). The most easy way to contribute is to [post an issue][issue], but
you're also welcome to [fork and make a pull request][fork]. (Note to self: Add
something for non-technical Classicists about how this model works.)
