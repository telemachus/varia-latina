# A commentary on Ovid's *Tristia*

## What is this?

This will eventually be a text and commentary on selections from Ovid's
*Tristia*.

If you have LaTeX, you should be able to build a pdf of the document by running
`make`. If you don't want to bother with that, you can also [download pdfs from
this site][pdf].

## How can I help?

I would love feedback on anything (my terrible LaTeX, the text, or the
commentary). The most easy way to contribute is to [post an issue][issue], but
you're also welcome to [fork and make a pull request][fork]. (Note to self: Add
something for non-technical Classicists about how this model works.)
