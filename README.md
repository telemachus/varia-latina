# Commentary on various Latin poems

## What is this?

This repository stores LaTeX text and commentary on various Latin poems.
Currently, there are two poems by Horace and one by Propertius.

If you have LaTeX, you should be able to build a pdf of the documents by running
`make`. 

## How can I help?

I would love feedback on anything (my terrible LaTeX, the text, or the
commentary). You can email me (peter@aronoff.org) or contact me on Twitter
(@telemachus).
